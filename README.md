## UI/UX:


### Project Goals:

The primary goal of The Dark Castle is designed to wow and amaze it's users, encouraging potential players to sign up to the closed, playable Beta of Bygone.Inc's upcoming title, The Dark Castle.

#### Player goals:

The central target audience for this game is young adults, aged 18-25 years old.

Player's Goals:

* Engage with a well thought out and interesting fantasy scenario.
* Have a challenging but rewarding experience.
* Compete and cooperate with friends and strangers with online play.
* Play a game with replayability value.
* Become immersed in every detail of the game world.
* Both fight and help friends and strangers through multiplayer gameplay.

The Dark Castle Fulfils these Criteria:

* Customise their experience through classes, skill trees and crafting.
* Controls are easy to learn but hard to master.
* Impressive sound design and exciting musical score.
* Extensive lore and world building.

* Multiplayer compatible, both co-operatively and competatively and online leaderboards.
* Providing special, unique powers from defeating unique bosses.
* The ability to transfer loot from one savegame to another.

Developer and Business Goals:

* Build an in depth crafting system that enables the player to customise their playstyle in minute detail.
* Create a beautiful but smooth-running experience for the player.

* Provide the player with replayability value, in line with the theory of creating games as a 

As a player of The Dark Castle I want to:

1. Engage with the game through easily accessible controls.
2. Have fun collecting experience points and collecting crafting ingredients.
3. Feel rewarded when gaining levels.
4. Feel like the skill points I recieve when gaining levels improve my character.
5. Get excited when reaching a milestone in the story, completing quests and defeating bosses.
6. Receive audio/visual effects and feedback that improve the user experience.
7. Enjoy a sense of balance between the available classes in strength and variety.
8. Become infatuated with gaining unique loot and grinding out enemy bosses.
9. Feel part of a community through online leaderboards.
10. Be able to choose how I interact online, whether that's through helping or harming.
11. Access the game through an informative but easy-going UI.
12. It needs to be quick and easy to deal with any errors or bugs that i encounter.
13. Customise my character through a spectrum of gameplay options and RPG elements.
14. Access audio/visual options that help the game run well on aging systems or disable audio, for instance.
15. Savegames should be alterable in name and in presence, so I need a delete savegame button.
16. A gametime countup to let me know how long I've spent on each character is important, so I know if i'm improving from one savegame to the next.
17. Be able to play a purely singleplayer game if i want to or can only play offline.
18. Access tutorials and hints, made by both the developer and the community, to assist me during gameplay.
19. Experience unique level design, so I always feel like I'm exploring, instead of going through gameplay loops and grinding.
20. Engage with quests, both big and small, whose rewards help me just as much as playing hack and slash style.
21. Each NPC I meet needs to be realistic and interesting.

#### Design Goals:

The general feel of the game is that it is designed for adults, who are looking for a mature, fantasy experience. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

##### Fonts:

* I used only the Georgia font because I felt it was clear to read but had a build whose ornamentation felt slightly archaic, which is in keepring with the setting of the game: it felt like a more easily legible typewriter font.

##### Icons:

* All icons were chosen in order to provide illustration for the feature headers below them. They were chosen to be understood by any user.

##### Colours:

* My primary colours were dark gray, black and white. They were chosen because they have good contrast with eachother.
* My secondary colours gold, black, gray and pale turqoise were chosen because they fit well with the pictures in the website. Each colour was given a specific purpose: pale turqoise links and golden titles, with a lighter cloured border that felt like a highlight to the overall body colour.

##### Styling:

* Borders are straight and solid to give a harsh tinge to the containers, so that whilst being accessible in colour, the mature theme of the advertised game is not ignored.
* Using a repeating container and differing button stlye was useful to convey to the user a clear structure to the website: there is available information on the project but that the developer really wants the potential player to apply for a spot in the closed Beta.
