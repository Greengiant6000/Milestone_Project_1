As a player of The Dark Castle I want to:

1. Engage with the game through easily accessible controls.
2. Have fun collecting experience points and collecting crafting ingredients.
3. Feel rewarded when gaining levels.
4. Feel like the skill points I recieve when gaining levels improve my character.
5. Get excited when reaching a milestone in the story, completing quests and defeating bosses.
6. Receive audio/visual effects and feedback that improve the user experience.
7. Enjoy a sense of balance between the available classes in strength and variety.
8. Become infatuated with gaining unique loot and grinding out enemy bosses.
9. Feel part of a community through online leaderboards.
10. Be able to choose how I interact online, whether that's through helping or harming.
11. Access the game through an informative but easy-going UI.
12. It needs to be quick and easy to deal with any errors or bugs that i encounter.
13. Customise my character through a spectrum of gameplay options and RPG elements.
14. Access audio/visual options that help the game run well on aging systems or disable audio, for instance.
15. Savegames should be alterable in name and in presence, so I need a delete savegame button.
16. A gametime countup to let me know how long I've spent on each character is important, so I know if i'm improving from one savegame to the next.
17. Be able to play a purely singleplayer game if i want to or can only play offline.
18. Access tutorials and hints, made by both the developer and the community, to assist me during gameplay.
19. Experience unique level design, so I always feel like I'm exploring, instead of going through gameplay loops and grinding.
20. Engage with quests, both big and small, whose rewards help me just as much as playing hack and slash style.
21. Each NPC I meet needs to be realistic and interesting.
